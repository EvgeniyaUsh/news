        "content": "<p>By Kevin Peachey\nPersonal finance correspondent, BBC News<p><p>Benefits should rise to match the soaring cost of living as millions face crippling price rises driven by energy bills, a think tank has said.<p><p>Many benefits and the state pension are inflation-linked, but - by convention - rates for this year were set before prices started rising rapidly.<p><p>It means most will only go up by 3.1% in April, half of the expected increase in the cost of living.<p><p>The government said it had already taken \"decisive action to help\".<p><p>The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said 10 million people were affected by price hikes that were not matched by benefit rises.<p><p>Raising benefits and the state pension to the same level as inflation in April would mean preventing a £290 real fall in benefit income year on year for this huge group, the economic research body said.<p><p>\"Doing so would compensate benefit recipients on average for higher costs, including energy costs. This need not be a permanent increase. Future up-rating can be adjusted once inflation has fallen back,\" said Robert Joyce, IFS deputy director.<p><p>Such a rise, albeit temporary, to benefits, Pension Credit and the state pension would cost the Treasury £4.5bn, which makes such a move highly unlikely, not least for political reasons.<p><p>Households with typical energy usage face a £600-700 rise in annual bills without government intervention. That would put a typical annual energy bill close to £2,000. The rise in the state pension set for April amounts to an annual increase of less than £300.<p><p>Chris O'Shea, chief executive of British Gas owner Centrica, told the BBC there was \"no reason\" to expect gas prices would come down \"any time soon\".<p><p>The IFS points out that lower-income households spend almost three times as much of their budgets on gas and electricity as the highest-income tenth on average (11% versus 4%).<p><p>It said that, to help these people, the government should consider a long-term change that meant rises in benefits and the state pension should not be linked to inflation seven months prior to the change, as is the case now. Instead, the decision should be taken much closer to April, when the increases take effect.<p><p>In the meantime, financial experts have said that everyone needs to brace for a year of rising prices.<p><p>\"Our budgets are coming under extreme pressure from the big squeeze, and for the next few months it is only going to get worse,\" said Sarah Coles, senior personal finance analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown.<p><p>However, the government said it had already taken \"£4.2bn of decisive action\".<p><p>\"This includes increasing benefits in line with the inflation measure from September, the Energy Price Cap which is saving 15 million households £100 a year on average, and winter fuel payments, which are supporting over 11 million pensioners with their energy bills,\" a government spokesperson said.<p><p>\"Our £500m Household Support Fund is also providing low income households with essentials over winter,\" they added.<p><p>British Gas owner warns high bills for two years<p><p>Experts say £10,900 a year needed to retire<p><p>Djokovic set to be deported from Australia<p><p>Djokovic 'extremely disappointed' but accepts decision<p><p>Tsunami threat over after Pacific eruption - monitor<p><p>Vigilantes take on Kenya's avocado gangs<p><p>Is the pandemic entering its endgame in UK?<p><p>The inventor inspired by a near-death experience.

        "content": "<p>By Dearbail Jordan\nBusiness reporter, BBC News<p><p>The UK economy surpassed pre-Covid levels for the first time in November after recording stronger-than-expected growth.<p><p>The Office for National Statistics said gross domestic product (GDP) expanded by 0.9% between October and November.<p><p>That was higher than economists' expectations and meant the economy was 0.7% larger than in February 2020.<p><p>But there is concern growth slowed again after the spread of Omicron and the introduction of Plan B measures.<p><p>\"The economy grew strongly in the month before Omicron struck, with architects, retailers, couriers and accountants having a bumper month,\" said ONS chief economist Grant Fitzner.<p><p>\"Construction also recovered from several weak months as many raw materials became easier to get hold of.\"<p><p>Analysts at Capital Economics said the economy was boosted by 3.5% growth in the construction sector, adding \"the unusually dry weather probably helped\".<p><p>It also said manufacturing output also improved and the professional sector also picked up, \"apparently due to architectural and engineering activities being brought forward from December\".<p><p>GDP or Gross Domestic Product is one of the most important ways of showing how well, or badly, an economy is doing.<p><p>It's a measure - or an attempt to measure - all the activity of companies, governments and individuals in an economy.<p><p>GDP allows businesses to judge when to expand and hire more people, and for government to work out how much to tax and spend.<p><p>Rising GDP means more jobs are likely to be created, and workers are more likely to get better pay rises.<p><p>If GDP is falling, then the economy is shrinking - bad news for businesses and workers.<p><p>The Covid pandemic caused the most severe recession seen in over 300 years, hurting business and employment, and forcing government to borrow hundreds of billions of pounds to support the economy.<p><p>Economists had been expecting GDP to expand by 0.4% in November.<p><p>Chancellor Rishi Sunak said the stronger growth was \"a testament to the grit and determination of the British people\".<p><p>But Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said: \"GDP almost certainly dropped in December, as households hunkered down in response to the Omicron variant.\"<p><p>The Omicron variant emerged at the end of November and Plan B measures were introduced on 8 December.<p><p>Mr Tombs said data such as restaurant diner numbers, transport usage and cinema revenues \"point to a pullback in consumer services expenditure\" last month, while \"Omicron also depressed labour supply\".<p><p>However, he added: \"Omicron looks set to fade almost as quickly as it arrived, thanks partly to the rapid rollout of booster jabs. As a result, we expect the government to allow Plan B rules to automatically expire on 26 January and for GDP to bounce back in February.\"<p><p>These figures show that the reopening and recovery of the UK economy was motoring just before Omicron struck.<p><p>The economy had for the first time regained, on a monthly basis, all the very heavy losses during the pandemic lockdowns. Business had been returning to something approaching normality after the government's decision to axe restrictions since the summer.<p><p>Monthly figures are quite volatile though and usually not provided by other countries. It is possible that the Omicron-linked hit to the economy in December could undo the impressive growth in November on the key fourth quarter figure. Using this more usual and internationally comparable quarterly basis, it is still not certain if the UK economy has recovered these losses.<p><p>The bigger question is about the impact of Omicron. With hopes that the rapidly-spreading variant has peaked, economists are now confident it will have far less of a hit than previous Covid waves. Retailers' results over the festive period have been very encouraging.<p><p>But the response of the public and its attitude to going out and spending is the big economic unknown. And while Omicron concern fades, the hits to disposable income from rising prices are very real.<p><p>So while the chancellor called today's GDP milestone \"amazing\" it's probably not the moment for celebration.<p><p>The ONS said that, on a quarterly basis, in the final three months of 2021 the UK economy will reach or surpass pre-Covid levels seen in the last quarter of 2019 if GDP grows by at least 0.2% in December and there are no downward revisions to figures for October and November.<p><p>However, several economists pointed to a bumpy road for growth in the first months of this year.<p><p>\"We expect growth to slow in 2022 as it will no longer be able to simply rely on the [Covid] rebound effect to propel it,\" said Yael Selfin, chief economist at KPMG UK.<p><p>\"In addition, rising taxes and borrowing costs, as well as elevated inflation, will squeeze households' purchasing power, while the lingering effects of supply chain bottlenecks together with a persistent shortage of labour could constrain production this year.\"<p><p>Inflation is expected to hit 6% by spring, according to the Bank of England which raised its key interest rate in December and is forecast to lift borrowing costs again this year.<p><p>The government will raise the National Living Wage by 6.6% for over 23 year-olds in April but that is the same month when energy regulator Ofgem will implement the new price cap on household gas and electricity bills.<p><p>Ofgem is widely expected to lift the price cap following a sharp rise in wholesale gas prices last year which forced around 20 smaller energy companies out of business.<p><p>Also from April, employers, workers and the self-employed will all pay 1.25p more in the pound for National Insurance.<p><p>Warning benefits will not keep up with rising prices<p><p>UK economic growth slower than first thought<p><p>What is GDP and how does it affect me?<p><p>Djokovic set to be deported from Australia<p><p>Djokovic 'extremely disappointed' but accepts decision<p><p>Tsunami threat over after Pacific eruption - monitor<p><p>Vigilantes take on Kenya's avocado gangs<p><p>Is the pandemic entering its endgame in UK?<p><p>The inventor inspired by a near-death experience.

        "slug": "us-supreme-court-blocks-biden-s-workplace-vaccine-mandate",
        "content": "<p>By Natalie Sherman\nBusiness reporter, New York<p><p>The US Supreme Court has blocked President Joe Biden's rule requiring workers at large companies to be vaccinated or masked and tested weekly.<p><p>The justices at the nation's highest court said the mandate exceeded the Biden administration's authority.<p><p>Separately they ruled that a more limited vaccine mandate could stand for staff at government-funded healthcare facilities.<p><p>The administration said the mandates would help fight the pandemic.<p><p>President Biden, whose approval rating has been sagging, expressed disappointment with the decision \"to block common-sense life-saving requirements for employees\".<p><p>He added: \"I call on business leaders to immediately join those who have already stepped up - including one third of Fortune 100 companies - and institute vaccination requirements to protect their workers, customers, and communities.\"<p><p>Former President Donald Trump cheered the court's decision, and said vaccine mandates \"would have further destroyed the economy\".<p><p>\"We are proud of the Supreme Court for not backing down,\" he said in a statement. \"No mandates!\"<p><p>The administration's workplace vaccine mandate would have required workers to receive a Covid-19 shot, or be masked and tested weekly at their own expense.<p><p>It would have applied to workplaces with at least 100 employees and affected some 84 million workers. It was designed to be enforced by employers.<p><p>Opponents, including several Republican states and some business groups, said the administration was over-stepping its power with the requirements, which were introduced in November and immediately drew legal challenges.<p><p>In the end, Joe Biden's vaccine mandates stood or fell based on judicial interpretations of federal statute, not principles of individual liberty or appeals to the greater good.<p><p>According to a majority of the Supreme Court, Mr Biden had the law on his side when ordering healthcare workers to get vaccinated, but using a 51-year-old workplace safety statute to implement a vaccine-or-test requirement on all large employers was a bridge too far.<p><p>Once again, the current balance of the Supreme Court comes into sharp relief, with four reliably conservative justices, three reliable liberal ones and two - Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Brett Kavanaugh - at the ideological fulcrum.<p><p>This mixed judicial bag is just the latest setback for a presidential Covid-response plan that frequently has seemed a step behind the latest twists in the pandemic. The administration was slow to encourage boosters and caught flat-footed by the Omicron-induced surge in demand for testing.<p><p>Now Mr Biden will either have to convince Congress to act on mandates - an unlikely prospect given the brick wall the rest of his agenda keeps hitting in the Senate - or figure out new ways to shepherd the nation out of the pandemic gloom.<p><p>In a 6-3 decision, the justices agreed with that argument, saying that the workplace safety rule for large employers was too broad to fall under the authority of the Department of Labor's Occupational Health and Safety Administration to regulate workplace safety.<p><p>\"Covid-19 can and does spread at home, in schools, during sporting events, and everywhere else that people gather,\" the court's majority wrote.<p><p>\"That kind of universal risk is no different from the day-to-day dangers that all face from crime, air pollution, or any number of communicable diseases.\"<p><p>\"This is no 'everyday exercise of federal power,'\" they added. \"It is instead a significant encroachment on the lives - and health - of a vast number of employees.\"<p><p>The more limited rule concerning more than 10 million staff at healthcare facilities that receive government funding did not pose the same concern, they decided, by 5-4.<p><p>That said imposing conditions on recipients of public money fit \"neatly\" into the authority of the Secretary of Health and Human Services.<p><p>The rulings come as some parts of the policies were due to go into effect this week. The court heard arguments in the case on Friday.<p><p>The rulings reflected the political make-up of the court, which now has a majority of justices appointed by Republican presidents.<p><p>The court's three liberal justices opposed blocking the vaccine mandate, saying such a decision \"stymies the federal government's ability to counter the unparalleled threat that Covid-19 poses to our nation's workers.\"<p><p>Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Brett Kavanaugh, seen as moderates in the conservative majority, joined the liberals in allowing the healthcare rule to stand.<p><p>The decision comes as the US experiences another wave of Covid-19 infections, with the Omicron variant spurring record cases and hospitalisation rates.<p><p>The Biden administration had estimated that instituting a vaccine requirement at big employers would save 6,500 lives and prevent 250,000 hospital admissions over six months.<p><p>More than 60% of Americans are fully vaccinated already. Independent of the government's regulations, some companies, including Google, Citibank and IBM, have started to move forward with their own requirements.<p><p>But the National Federation of Independent Businesses, a lobby group that was one of the lead plaintiffs challenging the government's workplace vaccine rule, had charged that it would burden small-business owners with new compliance costs, make it harder to fill positions and lead to lost profits and lost sales.<p><p>\"Today's decision is welcome relief for America's small businesses, who are still trying to get their business back on track since the beginning of the pandemic,\" said Karen Harned, executive director of the group's legal arm.<p><p>This video can not be played<p><p>The puzzle of America's record Covid hospital rate<p><p>Quebec to impose health tax on unvaccinated<p><p>Djokovic set to be deported from Australia<p><p>Djokovic 'extremely disappointed' but accepts decision<p><p>Tsunami threat over after Pacific eruption - monitor<p><p>Vigilantes take on Kenya's avocado gangs<p><p>Is the pandemic entering its endgame in UK?<p><p>The inventor inspired by a near-death experience.

Price gouging is not illegal or even unusual in the US pharmaceutical industry.<p><p>But Shkreli became a poster boy for corporate excess, and was dubbed \"Pharma Bro\" and the \"most hated man in America\".<p><p>In December 2015, he was charged with securities fraud charges and looting millions of dollars from two hedge funds he operated, MSMB Capital and MSMB Healthcare.<p><p>He was convicted of those charges, as well as scheming to prop up the stock price of Retrophin, the drug company he founded in 2011.<p><p>Before his sentencing, Mr Brafman told the judge that Shkreli is a \"somewhat broken\" person who suffered from depression and an anxiety disorder.<p><p>Mr Brafman said the US government would like to just \"throw away\" his client.<p><p>During the trial last year, Shkreli called the prosecution \"junior varsity\" in off-the-cuff remarks to reporters covering his trial.<p><p>Prosecutors sought a gag order on him after that outburst, but the judge denied their application.<p><p>After a jury found him guilty in August last year, Shkreli was allowed to remain free pending sentencing.<p><p>But a month later he offered social media followers $5,000 if they could bring him hair from former US presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, who repeatedly criticised him during her campaign.<p><p>A judge revoked bail and Shkreli was jailed.<p><p>Prosecutors moved to seize $7.4m of his assets, including a single copy of an album by American hip hop group the Wu-Tang Clan that the disgraced executive is said to have paid $2m for at auction in 2015.<p><p>Djokovic set to be deported from Australia<p><p>Djokovic 'extremely disappointed' but accepts decision<p><p>Tsunami threat over after Pacific eruption - monitor<p><p>Vigilantes take on Kenya's avocado gangs<p><p>Is the pandemic entering its endgame in UK?<p><p>The inventor inspired by a near-death experience.

        "content": "<p>By Lora Jones\nBusiness reporter, BBC News<p><p>Throughout the pandemic, working lives have been upended. Job losses, home-schooling, overtime hours, or a non-existent commute to the kitchen table - few people have been unaffected.<p><p>It's clear these changes have led some to rethink their career paths entirely. Almost a quarter of 6,000 workers, surveyed by recruitment firm Randstad UK, were planning to change jobs in the next few months.<p><p>A fresh job search might raise some big questions: What do I enjoy? What do I need to live comfortably? Is work working for me?<p><p>This is the first article in a new series called 'At Work' about how different people find purpose in their daily work.<p><p>One of them is firefighter, Elsie Emery.<p><p>I applied when I was 17, and turned 18 during the recruitment process.<p><p>I always knew that I wanted to be in the emergency services of some sort and was lucky that for the first time in nine years, the fire service was recruiting locally. So I was very lucky with the timings.<p><p>You don't need any particular qualification, but you have to pass online tests in Maths, English, mechanical reasoning, situational judgement and behavioural science before you get to go to your fitness assessment. Getting to Level 8.8 on a bleep test is not a joke! You have to be able to swim 50 metres in 70 seconds too to prove you're competent in water and you have to maintain these fitness levels throughout your career.<p><p>After that, you go to a practical assessment day with five different tests where you use all the different kit; simulate putting a ladder back on a truck, climbing a ladder, as well as doing things like taking your equipment apart and putting it back together - stuff you've never seen in your life.<p><p>Then the interview and presentation came at a later date and the whole process itself takes about six to nine months.<p><p>When fire services recruit, there's an inundation of people that want to go for it. In my particular round there were about 3,000 people for 15 jobs, so they needed to whittle it down. My parents were absolutely ecstatic when they found out I got the job.<p><p>College course: Complete Level 2, or 3, Diploma in Public Services, before applying to the fire service, although this is not essential.<p><p>Apprenticeship: You may be able to start training on an operational firefighter advanced apprenticeship. You'll need to be employed by a fire service to do this.<p><p>Apply direct: You can apply to your local fire service, each one sets its own entry requirements.<p><p>Fire service training course or volunteering: You can prepare for your application by volunteering, or doing a Level 2 Certificate in Fire and Rescue Services in the Community, which is usually run by local services.<p><p>Source:National Careers Service<p><p>No day is the same. Every time you go in there's something different or you can easily get held up on a visit [to a business].<p><p>[Every shift] we do a handover from the previous night or day shift, so we know what we need to follow up on.<p><p>We do a lot of equipment checks on the vehicles and our breathing apparatus, to make sure they're operational-ready. All our training needs to be maintained, so we know what to do at an incident. We might do a simulated rescue, or go out in the yard and cut a car for collision training.<p><p>On top of that, we do a lot of physical training. We've got a gym [at the] station to keep our strength up and do circuits.<p><p>And we do a lot of community visits - go out to vulnerable people in the community to prevent fires through education, set out evacuation plans, or, put up smoke detectors for them and run through fire safety stuff. We also do school visits so the kids can sit in the truck and go out to a lot of businesses too and do mini-audits on them.<p><p>Obviously, you also respond to incidents that come up. They can go on for a long time, 24 hours even.<p><p>It's weird, I dread telling people what I do. I cringe a little bit.<p><p>The common reaction is: 'Oh wow!', people are usually taken aback and aren't necessarily expecting it because of a lack of females in the role.<p><p>I remember once, pulling up to a roundabout in the truck and the window was down because it was a hot summer's day. A guy in the van next to me wound his down and shouted: \"Oh my gosh, I've never seen a woman one.\"<p><p>I do get comments, but they are mostly positive - or they make me laugh.<p><p>It's not all about saving cats in trees!<p><p>People do assume that we're out every hour of the day responding to incidents, or we're having a cup of tea waiting for a call.<p><p>There has been very little time where I've just sat around. And it's not as dramatic as in the films either. If we have a spare moment, we're doing business safety work, or we're out in the community.<p><p>The push is on [fire] prevention now. So the work we do in the community around us probably makes up about 80% of our time on-shift, but that's not really seen.<p><p>We do see unpleasant scenes and fatalities - that is, without a doubt, the hardest part of the job.<p><p>Day-to-day, it's odd but you almost want to have an incident of some sort - not where anyone's hurt - but because that's what you joined to do. I joined to be there in the moment and help people, whether that's putting up a smoke alarm or helping shift flood water from someone's house.<p><p>But when there are family members nearby and you need to support them during an incident - that is really challenging.<p><p>And for every hard moment, there are good ones.<p><p>Coming back from a difficult incident, we're always greeted within an hour by a 'diffusing officer'. The truck from that incident [then] comes 'off the run'.<p><p>The biscuits come out and we go around the room and talk about what we saw, if anything in particular stood out. It helps us to piece together what we did as a team and put it in neat, tidy piles in your brain before you go to sleep - reducing the impact of any post-traumatic shock disorder (PTSD) because of that discussion.<p><p>We go through a lot together, so we have a really strong bond. And now if I move house I've got five blokes to help.<p><p>The only thing I might say would be the training. [I'd like to have] more adaptability to train at different venues.<p><p>I think that's important because we can do as many drills as we like in the back yard, but having the chance to train in different conditions would be beneficial.<p><p>But in the job itself? Absolutely nothing. The team are basically my second family.<p><p>We're kept busy and all the jobs we're given are satisfying. We're constantly on training courses, always learning about things like blue light training, abseiling off a building or floating down the River Dart.<p><p>I can't even say I think we need more time off, because we get four days off a week!<p><p>Usually the weirdest stories come from people getting stuck in things.<p><p>We get called out to a lot of children getting stuck in babies' swings. They might brag to a friend saying they can still fit in there, and we then get called in to cut them out.<p><p>There have been a few stories about bath plug holes too... but I'll leave that to the imagination!<p><p>This interview has been condensed for clarity.<p><p>Where are all the job vacancies?<p><p>How to get your dream job<p><p>Djokovic set to be deported from Australia<p><p>Djokovic 'extremely disappointed' but accepts decision<p><p>Tsunami threat over after Pacific eruption - monitor<p><p>Vigilantes take on Kenya's avocado gangs<p><p>Is the pandemic entering its endgame in UK?<p><p>The inventor inspired by a near-death experience.

Movies were delayed, soap opera schedules were altered and video game releases were postponed.<p><p>For YouTube, however, it was a time of boom.<p><p>Research suggests that in 2021, the platform had 2.3 billion users worldwide. YouTube says one billion hours of video content is consumed on the platform every day.<p><p>Stokel-Walker said: \"YouTube was developed as something that would shake up the media industry and get rid of gatekeepers. It was going to democratise how our society and entertainment industry looks.<p><p>\"This list suggests that it's become more like TV than it would prefer to be. The arrival of money on the platform means content is very high stakes - and we see this in what MrBeast is making.<p><p>\"It's not really similar to anything else on YouTube. It's more like big-budget TV.\"<p><p>Stokel-Walker suggested the high production values of YouTube today are creating a barrier to entry, meaning you need to \"pay to play and be successful\".<p><p>The top earners as identified by Forbes are not necessarily those with the most views, but rather those who have been able to successfully earn money through brand partnerships, sponsorship deals and merchandise sales.<p><p>Although it's estimated that two-thirds of YouTube content is not in the English language, it seems that English-speaking creators are most able to financially capitalise on their popularity.<p><p>YouTube, like many other modern media platforms, is dealing with issues of misinformation and harmful content - however this doesn't seem to have affected its creators' abilities to attract advertisers and sponsors to their channels.<p><p>Here is the full top 10.<p><p>Preston Arsement grew his community largely thanks to videos centred around Minecraft, although he runs several channels on the website.<p><p>A regular on this list, he earned an estimated $16m (£11m) in 2021 - down a little from the year before, when he placed sixth.<p><p>The controversial boxer and vlogger was last in the top 10 in 2017. He earned $18m (£13m) in 2021.<p><p>Comedy pranksters Dude Perfect was number three on the list in 2020. They made $20m (£14m) last year.<p><p>The world's most famous toy reviewer has dropped from the top of the tree to number seven.<p><p>In 2021, his blend of toy reviews, educational videos and family vlogs helped him earn $27m (£19m).<p><p>The seven-year-old Russian has nearly 90 million subscribers on YouTube.<p><p>She started as a toy unboxer but now her vlogs and music videos are growing in popularity and her earnings have risen to $28m (£20m) in 2021.<p><p>A new entry, the Minecraft player has been uploading to YouTube for a decade.<p><p>He sold the rights to his back catalogue to the business Spotter last year, which contributed to his earnings of $28.5m (£20m).<p><p>A staple of the YouTube highest earning list, the hosts of geek chat show Good Mythical Morning earned $30m (£22m) in 2021.<p><p>Another regular gaming creator, Markiplier has used his business acumen to make a successful brand of merchandise, earning $38m (£27m) last year.<p><p>By branching out into boxing, Jake Paul has found himself back in the top 10. His high-profile fights against UFC stars helped him earn $45m (£32m) in 2021.<p><p>It's some turnaround for the creator who was criticised alongside his bother for some of their vlogs in 2017, which many found to be in poor taste.<p><p>With more boxing plans in the pipeline for 2022, it would be no surprise to see him keep his place among YouTube's elite on next year's list.<p><p>YouTube's top earner is a creator who uses stunts and pranks to delight his audience.<p><p>Last year, he recreated elements of Netflix hit Squid Game on his channel, played hide and seek in an 80,000-seater stadium and was buried underground.<p><p>His 10 billion views, alongside the MrBeast burger franchise, meant Jimmy Donaldson almost doubled his income in 2021 after ranking second on this list the previous year.<p><p>The people using YouTube to fund a French chateau<p><p>Paul knocks out Woodley for fifth win<p><p>The kids making up to $1m a year on YouTube<p><p>YouTube's top earners: Eight-year-old tops list<p><p>Djokovic set to be deported from Australia<p><p>Djokovic 'extremely disappointed' but accepts decision<p><p>Tsunami threat over after Pacific eruption - monitor<p><p>Vigilantes take on Kenya's avocado gangs<p><p>Is the pandemic entering its endgame in UK?<p><p>The inventor inspired by a near-death experience.

        "slug": "the-puzzle-of-america-s-record-covid-hospital-rate",
        "content": "<p>By Bernd Debusmann Jr & Holly Honderich\nBBC News, Washington<p><p>Even as the Omicron variant sweeps around the world, public health officials have noted that, in most cases, the number of Covid patients in hospitals remains significantly lower than during previous pandemic surges.<p><p>That's not the case in the US, however, where the number of patients with the coronavirus currently in hospital has reached record numbers.<p><p>According to data from the Department of Health and Human Services, 145,982 people were in hospital with the virus on 11 January, surpassing a previous record set in January 2021.<p><p>On Thursday, US President Joe Biden was expected to announce plans to deploy military medical personnel to help in six of the states hardest hit by the influx of patients.<p><p>Similarly, hospitals in large parts of neighbouring Canada have also seen surges, with Quebec reporting a pandemic high last weekend.<p><p>So what is going on, and why might North America's experience be different to South Africa and Europe so far?<p><p>Let's begin with this chart comparing how many people in several countries have been in hospital with Covid-19 during the pandemic. It's adjusted to account for population size and represents a ratio of the number of infected hospital patients per million inhabitants.<p><p>The various peaks represent times in which each nation was hit by a new Covid wave, including the initial outbreak and influx of hospital patients, last winter's surge or the summer spike caused by the Delta variant.<p><p>The green line, for example, shows how hard Italy was hit at both the beginning of the pandemic and again last year, reaching a high of 638 infected patients per million inhabitants on 23 November, 2020.<p><p>On the right side of the chart, every country has experienced a large spike in Covid-infected hospital patients due to Omicron. What's interesting, however, is to compare the rates each country is hitting now with those previous peaks.<p><p>For Italy, France, and the UK, we see that the number of patients in hospital with Covid remains much lower than in previous waves. In the UK, 291 patients with coronavirus per million were in hospital on 10 January. Just under a year ago, the ratio stood at 576 per million. In France, the ratio stood at 347 per million on the same day, compared with a high of 490 in November.<p><p>In the US, on the other hand, 411 US Covid-19 patients per million people were in hospital as of 9 January - surpassing a previous peak of 400 per million set on 14 January 2021.<p><p>Similarly, the data shows that in Canada, 206 people were in hospital per million as of 11 January, compared to previous peaks of 118 in April and 128 in January 2021.<p><p>Hospitals around the US have reported that the spike in infected patients has exacerbated pressure on facilities already strained by the pandemic.<p><p>Dr Juan Reyes, the director of hospital medicine at George Washington University in Washington DC - which is among the US cities with the highest per capita hospital admissions rate - said that this surge \"has been a lot more challenging\" than previous ones.<p><p>\"The challenge that we're feeling now is that it's happening at a larger volume and things are a little bit tighter,\" he told the BBC. \"The difference now is a lot of fatigue, on healthcare workers and the population at large.\"<p><p>Dr Lewis Rubinson, the chief medical officer of Morristown Medical Center in New Jersey, reported that the current admissions surge \"is about twice the size\" of its previous high in the winter of 2020, despite less severe infections among patients.<p><p>He attributed the rising numbers, partially, to increased testing of everyone who comes in the hospital for any reason. In the US, UK and Canada, newly admitted patients are tested for Covid regardless of what brought them to a hospital.<p><p>Still, \"the overall impact on hospitals by the sheer numbers is tremendous,\" he said. \"[If] you take off even a third of those, it's still an enormous amount of patients that we're tackling.\"<p><p>In the UK, this proportion of so-called incidental Covid cases has been estimated by National Health Service bosses to be between 20-30% of cases.<p><p>In South Africa - where the Omicron variant was first detected in November - researchers found that those infected with Omicron are less likely to be sent to hospital and more likely to recover quickly.<p><p>While up-to-date data regarding the rate of Covid patients in hospital per capita is not available, many South African hospitals reported that the number was significantly less than during previous surges.<p><p>The Steve Biko Academic Hospital in the City of Tshwane, for example, reported to the International Journal of Infectious Diseases that the number of infected patients was about half of that recorded before mid-November.<p><p>Researchers believe that South Africa's previous Covid-19 waves and relatively low vaccination rate meant that many residents had already likely been exposed and had built up some level of immunity.<p><p>Experts point to several reasons why the rate of Covid patients in hospital is higher in North America than in most other parts of the world.<p><p>Professor David Larsen, an epidemiologist and global health expert at Syracuse University in New York, told the BBC that the US population is markedly different from that of both Europe and South Africa.<p><p>\"We have an older population than South Africa. That's a big one,\" he said. \"[The US] is kind of similar in age structure to Europe. But there's also a less healthy population than in Europe.\"<p><p>As examples, Dr Larsen noted that rates of hypertension and obesity - both of which are comorbidities that increase the risk of Covid - are higher in the US than in most other countries.<p><p>Dr Larsen added that \"it's incredibly frustrating\" to hear Americans downplay the ongoing threat of Omicron and believe that, like South Africa, the US may soon emerge from the current surge.<p><p>\"The seasonality is also different,\" he said. \"Omicron's surge through South Africa was during their summer, and it's hitting us in winter when we know more people gather indoors and there's more transmission…it's going to be bad.\"<p><p>Dr Mark Cameron, an associate professor in the department of population and quantitative health sciences at Case Western University in Ohio, told the BBC that he believes the US is suffering from \"a perfect storm\" of Covid-19, comorbidities, uneven access to healthcare and hostility to vaccines, masks, and other preventative measures.<p><p>\"When all of that 'perfect storm' nature of vulnerabilities that are unique to the US combine, you've got an outbreak of the virus that can quickly lead from increased cases to increased hospitalisations, which tax the local hospitals and health community.\"<p><p>Just over 63% of the US population is fully vaccinated, much lower than in the UK (71%) as well as Italy and France (both 75%). In Canada, almost 79% of the population is fully protected.<p><p>Dr Donald Vinh, an infectious disease specialist at McGill University Health Centre in Montreal, said that in Quebec - and other places across Canada - as many as half of all new hospital admissions are among the \"inadequately vaccinated\".<p><p>\"As a percentage of the population, it's a low number. Maybe 10% of the eligible population are not doubly vaccinated,\" he said. \"They tend to be clustered in urban dense spots. When you have highly transmissible variants and it can affect an inadequately vaccinated population, this leads to ongoing propagation and the high community transmissions we're seeing.\"<p><p>Like the US, Dr Vinh said that he believes Canada is plagued by an \"incongruent\" public health policy when it comes to Covid-19.<p><p>\"In other words, there isn't a single unified method in how we're going to do things across the board,\" he said. \"It's more regional than national, and because of that you have gaps. The consequences of that are people getting hospitalised.\"<p><p>Doctors also warn that the high level of hospital admissions in the US and Canada may be due to the Delta variant being more prevalent in many areas.<p><p>A study published in August by The Lancet Infectious Diseases - which investigated 43,000 patients in the UK - found that the Delta variant had more than double the risk of hospital admission than previous variants.<p><p>Dr Monica Gandhi, an infectious diseases physician and professor at the University of California San Francisco, said that while she believes Delta patients form a significant portion of Covid-19 hospital admissions in the US, the true figure is hard to determine.<p><p>\"We don't know how much Delta there is,\" she told the BBC. \"What the US has started to do is look at the number of new infections and sequences. Omicron is 95% of new infections, but we don't know how much Delta we still have around.\"<p><p>In her own hospital, Dr Gandhi added, some patients \"are sicker and some are less sick, and that feels very much like Delta and Omicron are both there\".<p><p>In many countries, researchers believe that the Omicron variant has begun to subside, possibly signalling the end of the increase in hospital patients with Covid.<p><p>A computer model from researchers at the University of Washington, for example, has projected that the number of daily cases in the US will reach a high of 1.2 million by 19 January. Some researchers have predicted that cases may even peak sooner.<p><p>In the short-term, however, experts believe that hospitals will continue feeling the strain of elevated patient numbers in both the US and Canada, even as they fall in other countries.<p><p>\"The situation is bad. There's really no other word to describe it,\" Dr Vinh said of the pandemic in Canada. \"I would love to start seeing an inflection point that tells us we're at the plateau, but right now all I'm seeing is a hill. It's not even a hill anymore. It's a wall.\"<p><p>Dr Larsen, for his part, said he believes that the US needs \"more urgency around systemic change\" to move past Covid-19.<p><p>In the US, both Dr Cameron and Dr Gandhi suggested that they believe hospital admissions may peak in February or March.<p><p>\"It still could make for a miserable winter,\" Dr Gandhi said. \"I think that for the next month, life is going to be really hard in schools and hospitals.\"<p><p>Half of Europe will catch Omicron - WHO<p><p>Quebec to impose health tax on unvaccinated<p><p>Colds may give some Covid protection - study<p><p>India begins booster shots amid Covid case surge<p><p>Djokovic set to be deported from Australia<p><p>Djokovic 'extremely disappointed' but accepts decision<p><p>Tsunami threat over after Pacific eruption - monitor<p><p>Vigilantes take on Kenya's avocado gangs<p><p>Is the pandemic entering its endgame in UK?<p><p>The inventor inspired by a near-death experience.

It's led to newly qualified lawyers at top London firms being offered salaries of over £100,000 before bonuses.<p><p>According to the Law Society, in 2018 the average salary for solicitors working full-time in private practice was £62,000 a year (rising to £88,000 in London).<p><p>City banks have also boosted starter salaries to retain talent and Robert Walters predicts the bonus pool this year will be \"huge\".<p><p>Wages have also been increasing in lower paid jobs. Last week, Sainsbury's became the latest supermarket to pay shop workers at least £10 an hour, following similar moves from Morrisons, Lidl and Aldi.<p><p>Many workers have revaluated their careers during lockdown and changed jobs or left the workforce, in what some have labelled the \"great resignation\".<p><p>It has helped to drive up salaries across the UK, with growth in average pay including bonuses standing at 4.9% year-on-year between August and October.<p><p>James Reed, chairman of recruitment agency Reed Recruitment, said the UK was in the midst of a \"jobs boom\" that showed no signs of abating.<p><p>\"It's the best time in 50 years to look for a new job, in a situation where the pendulum has swung in jobseekers' favour.\"<p><p>Sainsbury's raises pay to £10 an hour<p><p>Starter salaries rise at fastest rate in 24 years<p><p>Job vacancies surge past one million in new record<p><p>Djokovic set to be deported from Australia<p><p>Djokovic 'extremely disappointed' but accepts decision<p><p>Tsunami threat over after Pacific eruption - monitor<p><p>Vigilantes take on Kenya's avocado gangs<p><p>Is the pandemic entering its endgame in UK?<p><p>The inventor inspired by a near-death experience.

        "slug": "the-people-using-youtube-to-pay-for-their-french-chateau",
        "content": "<p>By Kate Stanton\nBusiness reporter<p><p>Stephanie Jarvis credits YouTube with saving her vast French chateau.<p><p>She had bought the 40-room, 16th Century home back in 2005 after pooling resources with a friend.<p><p>Such French castles were relatively cheap at the time, so between them they were able to buy one for £590,000, raising the money by selling both of their two-bedroom London flats.<p><p>The plan was to turn the property - Chateau de Lalande, in the Centre-Val de Loire region of northern France - into a bed and breakfast, and hire it out for events.<p><p>However, Ms Jarvis admits that she didn't factor in just how expensive it would be to pay for the upkeep of such a huge, old building. \"I didn't realise how much money it would take to run,\" says the 50-year-old.<p><p>So, by the start of 2020, the chateau business had yet to make a profit. And then the Covid-19 pandemic arrived, and France went into lockdown.<p><p>\"It was going to be the first year that we were in profit for the bed and breakfast, but everything had been cancelled,\" she says. \"I had no money coming in, and nothing to do.\"<p><p>Then Ms Jarvis had a brain wave. Since 2018 she had been sporadically posting video blogs about her life at the castle up on social media platform, YouTube, under the channel name, The Chateau Diaries. She had started to do this after appearing in a TV renovation show, called Escape to the Chateau DIY, and found that she liked the experience of talking to the camera about her home.<p><p>With the pandemic shutting down everything else, Ms Jarvis decided that she'd now make and publish such videos on a daily basic \"and see how it goes\".<p><p>To her surprise, her YouTube channel soared in popularity, going up from 10,000 subscribers in 2019 to 173,000 today.<p><p>This meant that the money she made from the advertisements on her videos jumped from a few hundred euros to many thousands.<p><p>\"It escalated so fast, it was unbelievable,\" she says. \"I think a lot of people were finding themselves in quarantine, and wanting to see how other people were living through it.\"<p><p>\"The channel also gives people this hope that maybe they don't need to follow a traditional path, and then can still make something happen with their lives.\"<p><p>Ms Jarvis is now able to use the revenue from YouTube, along with the renewed income from the bed and breakfast, to pay four staff to work at the castle.<p><p>She also now gets additional funds from a Patreon account that she set up last year. Patreon is an online subscription platform that allows Ms Jarvis' subscribers to pay to view exclusive, extra video content. This is now said to make about £24,000 per month.<p><p>Another couple now making YouTube videos about life owning a French chateau are British designer Anna Mayrhofer and her Italian filmmaker husband Philipp.<p><p>They purchased their 18th Century Chateau Le Fleur, in Normandy, in 2019, using money from the sale of their Parisian apartment. Like Ms Jarvis, they also underestimated the total cost of the renovations that the property would need.<p><p>The couple started to post videos at the end of 2020, hoping it would serve as a marketing tool for when the pandemic ended and they could open their bed and breakfast.<p><p>Their YouTube channel - How To Renovate A Chateau (Without Killing Your Partner) - now has 133,000 subscribers, and brings in regular advertising revenue.<p><p>\"It never occurred to us that this could become an income stream as important as the guesthouse,\" says Mr Mayrhofer. \"But we get more and more advertising money, and it started to become almost like a salary.\"<p><p>The couple also launched a Patreon account, which has more than 750 subscribers paying from about £4.50-17.50 per month. Mr Mayrhofer says he and Anna are now so busy making video content it might make more financial sense to slow down the guesthouse side of their business.<p><p>\"For now, we enjoy [making videos]. It encourages us, and it's fun to do,\" he says.<p><p>Paris-based estate agent, Patrice Besse, specialises in selling chateaux dotted across France. He says that one in relatively good condition now costs between €800,000 ($900,000; £670,000) and €1,500,000. Cheaper properties require more restoration work, and therefore might end up costing more in the long term.<p><p>He cautions that buying a French chateau should not generally be seen as a way to make money. \"Any buyer knows that owning a chateau will not make you rich.\"<p><p>Instead, he says that owning a chateau is a \"way of life\", and that many buyers care less about the return on their investment, and more about the emotional journey of restoring an old property and the dream of living in one.<p><p>Yet he adds that per square metre \"chateaux are the cheapest real estate in France\", especially when compared to the cost of a Parisian apartment. And demand has risen as a result of the pandemic meaning that people want to leave France's big cities.<p><p>Fellow estate agent Christophe Chassin adds that the price of French chateaux has increased since the start of the pandemic, due to high demand.<p><p>New Economy is a new series exploring how businesses, trade, economies and working life are changing fast.<p><p>\"We made a lot of sales over the past 12 months,\" says Mr Chassin, who sells mostly to overseas clients from the UK, US, Australia and South America. \"And we are struggling to renew our portfolio of properties.\"<p><p>One person who bought a French chateau from Mr Chassin over the past year is American, Julia Leach.<p><p>The 30-year-old was inspired to purchase one after becoming an avid viewer of Ms Jarvis' The Chateau Diaries while she lived in New York.<p><p>\"The contrast was stark between the hustle and work culture I was immersed in, and the slower pace of life of Stephanie's videos pulled at my heart,\" says Ms Leach, who shared Jarvis' videos with her family in California.<p><p>So in April 2021, Ms Leach, her partner, sister and their parents pooled their financial resources to buy the 12-bedroom, 13th-Century Chateau du Puy Vidal in Charente, southwest France, for €2.2m (£1.8m).<p><p>Ms Leach, who previously worked in film and television production, plans to turn the castle into a studio facility for filmmakers. And she naturally has also set up a YouTube channel - Lady of the Chateau Productions - which already has 13,000 subscribers.<p><p>Back at Chateau de Lalande, Ms Jarvis says she can spend 40-60 hours a week filming and editing videos. \"There's nothing else I'd rather be doing,\" she says. \"I feel more tied to the chateau, but in a really positive way.\"<p><p>Djokovic set to be deported from Australia<p><p>Djokovic 'extremely disappointed' but accepts decision<p><p>Tsunami threat over after Pacific eruption - monitor<p><p>Vigilantes take on Kenya's avocado gangs<p><p>Is the pandemic entering its endgame in UK?<p><p>The inventor inspired by a near-death experience.

        "name": "The controversy of wood pellets as a green energy source",
        "slug": "the-controversy-of-wood-pellets-as-a-green-energy-source",
        "content": "<p>By Christine Ro\nBusiness of Technology reporter<p><p>This is the first of two Business of Technology articles examining the way wood pellets are produced and used as an energy source.<p><p>The areas in and around North Carolina's forests feel spacious. Canopies of lanky pine trees eventually give way to enormous car parks and long-term storage units, underscoring the feeling of vastness.<p><p>Many of these US trees are destined to be turned into small pellets for the biomass industry. At wood pellet mills, wood is chipped, dried, ground and compressed into uniform, easily storable pellets. They're then shipped mainly to the UK, where they're burned for energy.<p><p>Most forest land in North Carolina is privately owned, in holdings that can be as small as one acre (0.4ha). This can mean they are too small to qualify for conservation easements - agreements encouraging landowners to keep trees intact, sometimes with tax benefits.<p><p>Small forest owners here include a number of third-generation African Americans whose ancestors moved north and west as part of the Great Migration (the movement of six million African Americans between 1916-70 out of the rural southern US to the urban Northeast, Midwest and West) leaving the cropland to turn back into forest.<p><p>\"A lot of minority landowners are really disconnected from their land,\" says Freddie Davis III, a forester who leads the Rural Training and Research Center, which is part of the Federation of Southern Cooperatives.<p><p>Mr Davis believes that biomass is the best option on such low-value holdings for these owners - who typically live away from their forest land and often not even in the same state. \"I'm super passionate about it because it offers opportunity,\" he says.<p><p>Yet the racial justice aspect is complex. Sherri White-Williamson, who leads environmental justice policy for the North Carolina Conservation Network, works out of a cramped office in Clinton. The area has a large black population and is about 20 minutes away from a pellet mill. \"We've pretty much become the dumping ground for a lot of things for the sake of economic development,\" she says.<p><p>While the wood pellet industry is an important local employer, Ms White-Williamson argues that the effects on water, air and noise mean that these companies aren't the best of neighbours.<p><p>Volatile organic compounds from wood pellet manufacture, especially softwood like pine, are a problem because of the way they're converted into formaldehyde and other noxious substances, says Derb S Carter Junior, a lawyer at the Southern Environmental Law Center.<p><p>Enviva, the world's main producer of wood pellets, counters that its plants are in compliance with air quality regulations.<p><p>Biomass is controversial, not just locally for the effects on communities near pellet plants, but also globally for the unusual way that its carbon emissions are counted. Many argue that the current carbon accounting rules on wood pellets are not fit for purpose.<p><p>They are accounted at the harvest site, such as in North Carolina, rather than the place where they are actually burnt, notably at the UK's Drax power station in Yorkshire.<p><p>The reason for this is that because the trees are replanted, this form of energy is renewable. Decades ago, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) agreed under the Kyoto Protocol that it would be simpler to account for the carbon emissions of land use only when harvested.<p><p>But these decisions have been not just scientific but political, says Peg Putt, who coordinates biomass campaigns for the Environmental Paper Network: The negotiators mainly \"come out of the forest agencies of the various countries, have close ties to industry and work to advantage the interests of the forest industry,\" she argues.<p><p>\"They have made the accounting seem so forbiddingly complicated and technical that higher level negotiators in the party delegations just leave it to them.\"<p><p>More technology of business:<p><p>Lawyer Derb Carter says the US now has a \"proliferation\" of wood pellet mills \"where - they're all for export, mostly to Europe - and essentially no utilisation of this material here in the US for energy production\".<p><p>In 2018-19, all of the wood pellets fed into the UK's Drax power station were imported. Mr Carter says for the EU, UK, and increasingly Japan and South Korea, this system is \"almost a free ticket in some ways\".<p><p>The emissions from burning wood don't actually show up in these countries' emissions records, because of what he says are the \"perverse accounting\" rules on wood pellets' carbon emissions.<p><p>A growing number of scientists and policymakers understand that biomass is not an instantaneously carbon-neutral source of renewable energy. Mr Carter says it is a \"simplistic notion\" that trees are a renewable resource. Trees cut for biomass can take 30-100 years to fully grow back. Even if they store some carbon as they grow - the maximum amount of carbon dioxide is only absorbed by fully mature trees.<p><p>Drax defends it use of wood chips to make electricity.<p><p>\"Biomass is a reliable, flexible renewable power source which is available regardless of what the weather does. It therefore has a vital role to play in the energy system, displacing coal and supporting the grid to further decarbonise, by enabling more renewables like wind and solar to come online,\" a spokesperson said.<p><p>Wood pellet producer Enviva points out it is not sourcing from pristine forests, but managed forests which need to be thinned periodically to maintain good health, yet whose wood quality isn't high enough for higher-value markets like paper.<p><p>According to Enviva, its wood pellet mix is made up of 20% sawmill residues, 14% thinning, and the remainder from harvest.<p><p>Kim Cesafsky, Enviva's director of sustainability, is adamant that \"we directly displace coal\". She calls fossil fuels \"a one-way street\", in contrast to biomass.<p><p>Yet biomass is actually even more polluting than coal. \"Burning wood for energy produces at least as much carbon dioxide as burning coal per unit of energy produced and usually more,\" Ms Putt explains.<p><p>Wood is less energy dense than coal, so \"you have to put more into burning it to get the amount of energy that you want - therefore you release, generally, more carbon dioxide,\" she says.<p><p>Prof Gert-Jan Nabuurs, who researches forestry at Wageningen University, the Netherlands, is one of the coordinating lead authors of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). He acknowledges that wood does not burn as efficiently as natural gas or coal \"and that is why for the same amount of energy, you are emitting more\". But he argues that \"this biomass for bioenergy is a short cycle\" as the trees are replanted.<p><p>Yet this idea runs contrary to proforestation - the principle of keeping forests intact - because as diverse forests are replaced with plantations of a single tree species, this makes them not only more vulnerable to disease but also generally less efficient at sequestering carbon.<p><p>According to Ms Putt: \"Plantations are less carbon dense than are natural forests, generally speaking, and they get logged more frequently. So they have less opportunities to sequester carbon.\"<p><p>The second story on wood pellets in this series will cover how power stations are using biomass to generate electricity and will be published on Friday 14th January.<p><p>Reporting for this article was supported by the Exploring Biomass and Climate Change fellowship of the National Press Foundation.<p><p>Djokovic set to be deported from Australia<p><p>Djokovic 'extremely disappointed' but accepts decision<p><p>Tsunami threat over after Pacific eruption - monitor<p><p>Vigilantes take on Kenya's avocado gangs<p><p>Is the pandemic entering its endgame in UK?<p><p>The inventor inspired by a near-death experience.

        "slug": "as-a-black-woman-in-stem-i-m-used-for-photo-opportunities",
        "content": "<p>By Megha Mohan\nGender and Identity correspondent<p><p>When Cynthia Chapple was asked to help out with a photograph of a research professor and his staff, she assumed that she would be the one taking the photo. The image was going to be used by the professor for a grant application.<p><p>Ms Chapple, then a chemistry researcher at a US university, didn't work with his team directly and had minimal interactions with them personally. Yet, when she arrived to take the photo she was pulled in front of the camera, alongside the team. Confused, she smiled for the picture before an uncomfortable realisation dawned on her.<p><p>She looked around her: the research team were all white men, and she was the only black woman in the photo.<p><p>\"This was an example of 'Photoshop' diversity, when black women are used for photo opportunities,\" she tells the BBC, \"I was being used to show he worked in an inclusive team and to secure him funding. I was embarrassed.\"<p><p>The 31-year-old grew up in an inner-city neighbourhood on the south side of Chicago.<p><p>She grew up in a large family with seven siblings, her whole universe existed within a two-block radius. Her father worked as a security guard and her mother worked as a nursing assistant. Cynthia's school, her extended family and all her friends were just five minutes away and evenings were spent exploring the neighbourhood.<p><p>\"I would make lists of ways to improve the neighbourhood,\" she says, \"I would count the number of liquor [alcohol] stores, or unused lots in the area and write up proposals on what they could be replaced with, in order to improve the area. I was data gathering.\"<p><p>When she was aged nine years old, a particularly passionate teacher ignited in her a love of maths.<p><p>\"Mr Estes was a young black teacher who I wanted to impress. He was my entry to STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics).\"<p><p>Through him, she was introduced to science summer camps and extra-curricular clubs and she fell in love.<p><p>\"I was the only black girl in those clubs,\" she recalls. \"There weren't really a lot of activities around STEM that you could do in my neighbourhood. So, I found myself sort of leaving my south side community and going elsewhere - to get exposure to certain activities.\"<p><p>But leaving the south side of Chicago didn't mean she found more women interested in STEM. She still felt in a minority while studying for her bachelors degree in chemistry at Purdue University, Indianapolis. Things were no different when she went to another university to study for her masters.<p><p>\"I was one of two American-born Black students,\" she says.<p><p>When she graduated and became a research chemist she noticed another trend. That she couldn't see women of colour, especially black women, rising to higher ranks in US academia - especially in STEM fields.<p><p>Cynthia says she puts this situation down to the \"intersectional leaky pipeline\"; her spin on the so-called 'leaky pipeline', which is a metaphor for the progressive loss of competent women from senior positions in the fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM).<p><p>Researchers say that the 'leaky pipeline' refers to women, and particularly women of colour, facing many barriers and obstacles to advancing further in their fields, from childcare obligations to fewer promotion opportunities.<p><p>Pew Research from 2021 says that black people made up only 9% of all STEM related workforce in the US and that is a number that has not changed since 2016.<p><p>Similarly, according to the American Psychology Association, women of colour make up only 2.3% of tenured (permanent) university teaching staff in the US, whereas white women make up 23.4%.<p><p>Cynthia had an idea whilst doing her masters in 2015, that she would create a club to pull more women like her in to the world of science. By 2018, Black Girls Do STEM became an after-school community in St Louis, Missouri - where she now lives.<p><p>The aim of the club is to give middle and high school black girls, from inner-cities, the chance to emotionally engage with science and apply it to real life.<p><p>\"We design our classes around what they like, what they need, their interests,\" she says, \"We have classes showing the girls how to make lip balm as part of a cosmetic chemistry module, or it could be where we look at household products and test their pH.\"<p><p>The fortnightly classes used to be held in person but have moved online throughout the pandemic.<p><p>\"We want it to be an immersive experience,\" she adds.<p><p>Currently, around a hundred girls take part in Black Girls Do STEM. Ms Chapple has expanded the scheme to pull in more black women science mentors and introduced classes to teach the girls about resilience and establishing boundaries.<p><p>\"As a young Black woman, you need a range of tools to succeed in the workplace and we want to equip the girls for more than academic success,\" she says.<p><p>More than 160 girls have expressed interest to take part in classes for 2022 and Cynthia hopes to scale this further throughout the country.<p><p>\"Inner city urban communities allow for creativity,\" she says. \"We have more noise, more pollution, more people, so we find creative solutions to problems. Our communities have created some of the best music and fashion. We may also have the greatest scientific minds, given the opportunity.\"<p><p>Ms Chapple also wants to change the inaccessible reputation of science.<p><p>\"We look at science as something very elite, which only a few people can learn. And that's just not true,\" she says, \"You have to start early and give kids a foundation and kids live up or down to our expectations.\"<p><p>This story is part of the Generation Change series, a co-production by the BBC and Nobel Prize Outreach.<p><p>You can hear Cynthia's story and more from other young people innovating in the world of science, technology, engineering and mathematics on Generation Change on The Documentary, BBC World Service.<p><p>Hamilton launches black teacher scheme<p><p>Can a solar-powered fridge get more people jabbed?<p><p>The teenager who made medical history to save her mum<p><p>The woman working to get unwanted food to the hungry<p><p>Djokovic set to be deported from Australia<p><p>Djokovic 'extremely disappointed' but accepts decision<p><p>Tsunami threat over after Pacific eruption - monitor<p><p>Vigilantes take on Kenya's avocado gangs<p><p>Is the pandemic entering its endgame in UK?<p><p>The inventor inspired by a near-death experience.

        "content": "<p>By Padraig Belton\nBusiness reporter<p><p>If you have ever dreamed of earning money from a stellar music career but were concerned you had little talent, don't let that put you off - a man called Alex Mitchell might be able to help.<p><p>Mr Mitchell is the founder and boss of a website and app called Boomy, which helps its users create their own songs using artificial intelligence (AI) software that does most of the heavy lifting.<p><p>You choose from a number of genres, click on \"create song\", and the AI will compose one for you in less than 30 seconds. It swiftly picks the track's key, chords and melody. And from there you can then finesse your song.<p><p>You can do things such as add or strip-out instruments, change the tempo, adjust the volumes, add echoes, make everything sound brighter or softer, and lay down some vocals.<p><p>California-based, Boomy, was launched at the end of 2018, and claims its users around the world have now created almost five million songs.<p><p>The Boomy website and app even allows people to submit their tracks to be listed on Spotify and other music streaming sites, and to earn money every time they get played.<p><p>While Boomy owns the copyright to each recording, and receives the funds in the first instance, the company says it passes on 80% of the streaming royalties to the person who created the song.<p><p>Mr Mitchell adds that more than 10,000 of its users have published over 100,000 songs in total on various streaming services.<p><p>\"Eighty-five per cent of our users have never made music before,\" Mr Mitchell tells the BBC. \"And now we've got people who were paying their rent, and augmenting their income, with $100 (£74) or $200 a month from Boomy during Covid.\"<p><p>But, how good are these Boomy created songs? It has to be said that they do sound very computer generated. You wouldn't mistake them for a group of people making music using real instruments.<p><p>However, using AI to help compose music isn't exactly new: US classical composer, David Cope, developed such a software system back in the 1980s, following some episodes of writer's block.<p><p>One day he set it up to write compositions similar to those by Johann Sebastian Bach. Mr Cope then popped out for a sandwich, and returned to find that the computer had composed 5,000 Bach-inspired chorales. These were later released on an album called Bach by Design.<p><p>More recently, in 2019, Berlin-based US electronic music composer, Holly Herndon, made an album called Proto in collaboration with an AI system called Spawn that she had co-created. Ms Herndon is an expert in this field, and has a doctorate in music and computing from Stanford University in the US.<p><p>Mr Mitchell says that what has changed in recent years is that technological advancements in AI have meant song-writing software has become much cheaper.<p><p>So much so that Boomy is able to offer its basic membership package for free. Other AI song creator apps, such as Audoir's SAM, and Melobytes, are also free to use.<p><p>While AI composition inevitably grabs the headlines because of its novelty, new tech is continuing to change many other aspects of the wider music industry.<p><p>When the City and County of San Francisco imposed strict lockdowns back in 2020, Matthew Shilvock says that keeping an opera company going proved \"extremely challenging\".<p><p>He is general director of the San Francisco Opera, and it could no longer have \"two singers, or even a singer and pianist, in the same room\".<p><p>But when he tried running rehearsals with his performers online, \"traditional video conference platforms didn't work\", because of the latency, or delays in the audio and video. They were out of sync.<p><p>So, Mr Shilvock turned to a platform called Aloha that has been developed by Swedish music tech start-up Elk. It uses algorithms to reduce latencies.<p><p>Elk spokesman, Björn Ehler, claims that while video platforms like Zoom, Skype, and Google Meet have a latency of \"probably 500 to 600 milliseconds\", the Swedish firm has got this down to just 20.<p><p>Mr Shilvock says that, when working remotely, Aloha has \"allowed me to hear a singer breathe again\".<p><p>He adds that looking to wider tech to help solve problems is only natural for an opera house with Silicon Valley on its doorstep. \"The energy and the drive to find solutions through technology is just so much part of the DNA of this city.\"<p><p>Meanwhile in Paris, Aurélia Azoulay-Guetta says that, as an amateur classical musician, she \"realised how painful it is to just carry, store, and travel with a lot of physical sheet music for rehearsals, and how much time we waste\".<p><p>So she and her fellow co-founder \"decided to junk our jobs\" and launch a start-up called Newzik, which allows music publishers and composers to digitally distribute their sheet music to orchestras.<p><p>New Tech Economy is a series exploring how technological innovation is set to shape the new emerging economic landscape.<p><p>Ms Azoulay-Guetta says that her solution replaces the stress of musicians having to turn physical, paper pages with their hands during performance or rehearsal. Instead, they now turn a turn a digital page via a connected pedal.<p><p>And if the arrangement of a concerto or other composition is tweaked - which can be done by using an electronic pen on the app screen - this will update on every orchestra member's copy of the electronic music sheets.<p><p>Ms Azoulay-Guetta says that this feature particularly helped when concerts finally resumed after lockdowns, because orchestras and ensembles faced last minute programme changes - for instance, if musicians were absent, self-isolating.<p><p>Other tech firms are focusing on helping musicians more effectively deal with their paperwork. One such company is Portuguese start-up Faniak.<p><p>Founder and chief executive, Nuno Moura Santos, describes its app as \"like a Google Drive on steroids\", allowing musicians - who are often freelancers -to more easily do their admin all in one place, \"so they can spend more time writing and playing music\".<p><p>Back at Boomy, Mr Mitchell is himself a classically-trained violinist. He says that the firm's users are now popping-up everywhere.<p><p>\"We have Uber drivers creating albums and playing them during their drives,\" he says. \"And [last year] I woke up to a frantic call from my head of engineers, asking if we were under attack.<p><p>\"There was tons of traffic from Turkey, and we don't have a Turkish version. It was just a YouTuber in Turkey, who did a video about Boomy, and [from that] we have tens of thousands of users there.\"<p><p>Djokovic set to be deported from Australia<p><p>Djokovic 'extremely disappointed' but accepts decision<p><p>Tsunami threat over after Pacific eruption - monitor<p><p>Vigilantes take on Kenya's avocado gangs<p><p>Is the pandemic entering its endgame in UK?<p><p>The inventor inspired by a near-death experience.

        "slug": "the-green-row-over-the-uk-s-largest-renewable-power-plant",
        "content": "<p>By Christine Ro\nBusiness of Technology reporter<p><p>This is the second of two articles examining the way wood pellets are produced and used as a green energy source. The first article can be found here.<p><p>The Drax power station near Selby, Yorkshire, is surrounded by both busy roads and small farms. A faint humming noise emanates all around the complex, while water vapour rises slowly and steadily from the cooling towers.<p><p>The scale of operations at this converted coal plant is gargantuan. It's the UK's largest renewable power station. Wood pellets are imported from the US on enormous ships that take up to 21 days in transit. They are then transported overland via rail, and Drax receives about 17 deliveries of wood pellets a day, operating 24 hours a day, six days a week.<p><p>Once inside, the pellets are pulverised into a powder, blown into boilers and then burnt. The steam from this process powers turbines that produce electricity.<p><p>In 2020, Drax generated 11% of the UK's renewable power - enough for four million homes. While the UK is by far the largest consumer of wood pellets, globally, biomass is a massive industry that is growing in value and reach.<p><p>The EU is also a major market, and South Korea and Japan are increasingly interested as well. This means that the search has widened for new sources of wood, for instance from Estonia.<p><p>Yet, Drax's green credentials have been comprehensively challenged by environmentalists and others recently. The climate think tank, Ember, calculates that the power station is now the UK's single largest source of carbon dioxide. The firm's share price weakened on this news breaking although it has subsequently regained ground. The stock was removed from the S&P Global Clean Energy Index in October after the index changed its methodology.<p><p>When it comes to the arcane world of climate accounting, biomass energy is classed as renewable based on the premise that trees grow back. So greenhouse gas emissions from trees are counted in the nation of land use rather than the place where they are burnt.<p><p>Yet, Mary Booth, founder of the environmental organisation Partnership for Policy Integrity, points out that \"just because something is counted as zero because of an accounting convention does not mean it's carbon neutral\".<p><p>More technology of business:<p><p>According to the think tank Chatham House, wood pellets from the US burnt in the UK generated 13-16 million tonnes of CO2 emissions in 2019 - equivalent to the emissions from 6-7 million cars.<p><p>Drax disputes this analysis and a company spokesperson says its biomass \"meets the highest sustainability standards and these ensure that we do not use biomass that causes deforestation, forest decline or carbon debt\".<p><p>Drax's latest annual report shows that its largest source of biomass pellets is low-grade roundwood. This is not waste and residue but wood that has little economic value. Yet it still has environmental value, if it were left intact to soak up atmospheric carbon.<p><p>In 2020, the company received £832m in UK government subsidies - which are set to continue until at least 2027. According to many environmentalists, this support would be better directed to wind and solar energy, which are more energy efficient, cost-effective and more carbon neutral.<p><p>At Glasgow's COP26 climate summit, officials did not take a clear stance on biomass - a leading EU climate official called for its biomass use, though with reservations.<p><p>However, the Glasgow Leaders' Declaration on Forests and Land Use, signed by leaders of over 130 countries, does commit them to curbing forest loss by 2030.<p><p>It is as yet unclear how this is to be done. Elly Pepper, a campaigner at transatlantic environmental coalition, Cut Carbon Not Forests, warns the agreement will fail if countries do not come to terms with their dangerous reliance on biomass.<p><p>\"It's hypocritical for countries, including the UK, to sign this declaration while continuing billions in subsidies for this dirty energy industry,\" she says.<p><p>It seems unlikely that the UK government will end Drax's biomass subsidies ahead of their contracted end date in 2027. Some environmentalists have turned their sights instead to influencing future UK policy, such as the Biomass Strategy 2022. They're also hoping to reform the EU's Renewable Energy Directive, which subsidises biomass energy.<p><p>Peg Putt, who coordinates biomass campaigns for the Environmental Paper Network, worries that COP 26 could actually worsen the reliance on biomass.<p><p>The agreement on \"the phase down of unabated coal power\" could actually be interpreted as permitting mixing biomass with coal, she says, because \"throwing biomass in with coal and co-firing appears to magically decrease the emissions and thus the emissions intensity of coal generation\".<p><p>Drax, meanwhile, is looking beyond the next decade. It has proposed the development of BECC, or bioenergy with carbon capture and storage. This is a technology that essentially removes and stores carbon dioxide.<p><p>Drax argues that putting carbon dioxide under the North Sea will turn its operations carbon negative. Yet many environmentalists counter that this would just be a further licence to pollute.<p><p>Though there's been a public consultation process for the BECCS project, locals generally are not sure what is being proposed. The thick folders explaining the proposal at the library and the Drax-affiliated social club have been roundly ignored, while the consultation documents staked to a village field have whipped forlornly in the wind.<p><p>The future sourcing of energy is an especially hot topic due to the UK's current energy crisis.<p><p>A dramatic rise in the price of wholesale gas is the main reason consumers are facing huge increases in energy bills, and has also caused the collapse of some energy providers.<p><p>Drax says that biomass is a reliable alternative source of energy, but many environmentalists remain sceptical.<p><p>\"We need real transformative change, not false solutions like biomass,\" says Ms Pepper.<p><p>Reporting for this article was supported by the Exploring Biomass and Climate Change fellowship of the National Press Foundation.<p><p>Controversy over wood pellets as a green energy source<p><p>Djokovic set to be deported from Australia<p><p>Djokovic 'extremely disappointed' but accepts decision<p><p>Tsunami threat over after Pacific eruption - monitor<p><p>Vigilantes take on Kenya's avocado gangs<p><p>Is the pandemic entering its endgame in UK?<p><p>The inventor inspired by a near-death experience.

        "name": "Scotch whisky on the table in trade talks with India",
        "slug": "scotch-whisky-on-the-table-in-trade-talks-with-india",
        "content": "<p>Douglas Fraser\nBusiness/economy editor, Scotland<p><p>A bottle of Scotch whisky arriving in the port of Mumbai faces a colossal 150% import tariff, yet it hasn't stopped Indians from being enthusiastic drinkers of a dram.<p><p>India is the world's biggest market for whisky, most of it termed \"Indian-made foreign liquor\". The big brands sound more Speyside than sub-continental: McDowell's, Royal Stag, Bagpiper, Peter Scot.<p><p>Domestic distillers have lobbied fiercely and successfully to limit Scotch imports. If the bottle is sold in Mumbai or elsewhere in the state of Maharashtra, it used to carry a further 300% tariff, though that was recently halved.<p><p>Among other parts of the Indian union, some don't allow alcohol sales at all, except to those who know how to get round the rules.<p><p>Scotch makes up only 2% of India's market. Yet the value of Scotch whisky sales to India has risen from below £60m in 2011 to more than £150m in 2019. That has been on the soaring growth of the economy and the country's burgeoning middle class, with its drouth for prestige international products and brands.<p><p>By volume, last year saw India become the third biggest market for Scotch. But as 60% of that is in bulk, for bottling in India or for blending with local spirits, that is lower value Scotch than exported to other markets.<p><p>So imagine what could be sold with lower tariffs. There's a big prize from getting them removed, or at least slashed. And that puts whisky firmly on the table of the talks, which began this week, aimed at a free trade agreement between the UK and India.<p><p>Oxford Economics doesn't imagine what could be sold: it models it. Commissioned by the Scotch Whisky Association, it assumes that the import tariffs come down to around 25%.<p><p>With that, it estimates £1.2bn more exports within five years, and that could generate 1,300 jobs in the UK.<p><p>And part of the pitch to the Indian government is that such trade liberalisation would only take Scotch from 2% to to around 6% of the nation's consumption, while boosting Delhi's government revenues by more than £3bn. That way, everyone wins.<p><p>But trade liberalisation isn't that simple, particularly in India. One of the first problems is getting to an agreement on the valuation of an import consignment before it even leaves the port. That can take a very long time, and a free trade deal would have to simplify that process.<p><p>The application of rules can be, let's say, unpredictable. One key part of any free trade deal would be a court of arbitration. But as Edinburgh-based Cairn Energy found (it recently rebranded as Capricorn), such existing international rules on investment can get stuck in Indian bureaucracy and legal obstacles.<p><p>Having developed the country's biggest oil field and sold its stake, Cairn's attempts to reclaim at least $1bn owed by the Delhi tax authorities only began to make progress after it started action to seize the government's overseas assets.<p><p>After leaving the port, imports of whisky into India then hit 30 different markets, across India's states, requiring different labelling, with different duty and retail rules. Some states have a government monopoly in retailing alcohol, which is open to abuse by those in power.<p><p>Those in the distilling industry who have been trying to break down the barriers to trade have low expectations of those internal trade barriers being removed under a deal between the UK government and the federal trade ministry in Delhi.<p><p>A deal between national governments would be a big breakthrough, but just the start of a new chapter in trying to crack this market.<p><p>After 10 years of the European Union trying, but failing, to get a free trade deal, in which Scotch whisky also played a prominent part, there is some optimism that the mood in India has shifted.<p><p>A crucial part of that is that the domestic distilling industry now has more international ownership.<p><p>The flamboyant businessman Vijay Mallya, who bought Scotch distiller Whyte & Mackay to add to India's biggest distiller, United Spirits - along with his empire of brewing, a large airline, premier league cricket, a Formula 1 team and a seat in India's parliament - is out of the picture now. Living in London, the sun has set on his empire, and he is fighting extradition to his homeland to face charges of money laundering on a vast scale.<p><p>Much of United Distillers is now owned by Diageo, the London-headquartered global drinks giant which happens also to own around 40% of Scotch production.<p><p>So it is now a big player in Indian distilling and in Scotch, plus gin, tequila, rum and Guinness, which it would dearly love to get into the Indian market. By no coincidence, Indian distillers seem to be putting up less lobbying resistance to imports of Scotch.<p><p>So could this now be the breakthrough for Scotch into the world's biggest whisky market?<p><p>The UK government, with a new-ish trade secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan, is eager to show progress post-Brexit on reaching beyond European trade to \"Global Britain\". There isn't much prospect of a breakthrough deal anywhere else.<p><p>Whitehall brings inexperience to the table, while India's trade negotiators have lots of experience, much of it in refusing to compromise due to domestic politics and an under-current of belief that India can be self-sufficient.<p><p>The trade talks are likely also to feature the desire of Britain's financial sector to get into the Indian market, to which it currently exports only a 10th of its sales to Japan.<p><p>That would require dismantling of massively complex regulatory barriers.<p><p>Its lead trade body, CityUK, wants to see fewer restrictions on data flows, and visas for British nationals to work at least temporarily in India. Having seen Cairn Energy and others snared, it is also seeking protection for investments.<p><p>The car industry, including Indian-owned Jaguar Land Rover, wants to get access to wealthy customers on the sub-continent.<p><p>And India has its own negotiating priorities, starting with much lower barriers for its professionals to work in the UK.<p><p>Its view of world trade is the projection of the power of the Indian diaspora - a huge English-speaking pool of technical skills and entrepreneurial flair.<p><p>But welcoming many more Indians into Britain could be seen as running counter to the spirit of Brexit, which was to keep foreign workers out.<p><p>That would be a tricky political compromise for the UK government to sell to its supporters. It's one that the Home Secretary, Priti Patel - herself a daughter of that Indian diaspora - is reported to be firmly against.<p><p>A trade deal with India in 2022 would be a big prize<p><p>Dark truth of India's post-lockdown liquor lines<p><p>UK approves Vijay Mallya extradition<p><p>Djokovic set to be deported from Australia<p><p>Djokovic 'extremely disappointed' but accepts decision<p><p>Tsunami threat over after Pacific eruption - monitor<p><p>Vigilantes take on Kenya's avocado gangs<p><p>Is the pandemic entering its endgame in UK?<p><p>The inventor inspired by a near-death experience.

It found the term \"tax rebate\" gets more than 40,000 Google searches a month.<p><p>Some of these third-party firms use similar branding and language to the HMRC, Which? said.<p><p>Jenny Ross, Which? money editor, said their research showed huge numbers of people were coming into contact with firms hoping to persuade them to use their services to claim rebates, costing people \"potentially hundreds of pounds\".<p><p>\"For most people with a rebate to claim, HMRC is the best port of call. Go to its website directly to ensure you aren't left footing any unnecessary bills,\" she said.<p><p>One of the most common tax claims is for Marriage Allowance, Which? said, which allows one spouse to transfer 10% of their tax-free personal allowance to their partner if their partner earns less than the current personal allowance, and it can be backdated up to a total of £1,220.<p><p>While firms are permitted to charge a \"reasonable amount\" for such services, Which? said it found one firm, Tax Credits Ltd, was charging a service fee of 48%.<p><p>Tax Credits said: 'We spend a significant amount on marketing and providing access to this potential tax relief. In many cases it's our advertising, not HMRC's, that makes a person aware of it.<p><p>\"We then present the claimant with a simple mechanism to access the potential overpayment of tax. Our remuneration is contingent on a repayment being secured, and the amount we retain is reflective of this,\" it added.<p><p>Which? said customers who have been misled by websites into thinking they were dealing with the tax authority directly should make a complaint to the Citizens Advice Consumer Service.<p><p>HMRC waives fines again for late self-assessment<p><p>Warning benefits will not keep up with rising prices<p><p>Djokovic set to be deported from Australia<p><p>Djokovic 'extremely disappointed' but accepts decision<p><p>Tsunami threat over after Pacific eruption - monitor<p><p>Vigilantes take on Kenya's avocado gangs<p><p>Is the pandemic entering its endgame in UK?<p><p>The inventor inspired by a near-death experience.
